    <h1>Privacy Policy — Vinandi</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>November 12, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Vinandi</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “Vinandi”). Vinandi is an educational app that allows users to create an account, subscribe to services, and learn through video content. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly and information collected automatically when you use the app.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, username, password (securely hashed), and profile information you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> If you subscribe, we may collect payment details (card metadata) via third-party payment processors. We do not store full payment card numbers on our servers. (See <em>Third-party services</em> section.)</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> messages you send us (support requests, feedback) and any other content you submit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> pages/screens visited, videos watched, session length, features used, and other interaction data to improve the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & technical data:</strong> device type, operating system version, app version, IP address, and unique device identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies & similar technologies:</strong> cookies, local storage, and other tracking technologies used to provide and enhance functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To create and manage your account and provide the Vinandi service.</li>
      <li>To deliver video content, course material, and subscription services.</li>
      <li>To process payments and manage billing (through third-party payment processors).</li>
      <li>To send administrative messages, updates, and support replies.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve the app, troubleshoot issues, and personalize content recommendations.</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent and respond to fraud, abuse, security incidents and violations of our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing (if you are in the EEA)</h2>
    <p>Our legal bases for processing personal data include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance of a contract (providing the app and subscription services).</li>
      <li>Your consent (for optional analytics or marketing communications where applicable).</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests (improving the service, ensuring security) balanced against your rights.</li>
      <li>Compliance with legal obligations where required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share your information in the following limited ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services for us (hosting, analytics, payment processing, email delivery). These providers are contractually limited to use data for the purposes we specify.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> if required by law, to respond to legal process, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Vinandi, our users, or others.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> if Vinandi is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction (with notice).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services & Hosting</h2>
    <p><strong>Hosting & publishing:</strong> The Vinandi website and static content may be published using GitHub Pages / GitHub repository for hosting the website (or similar). Note that GitHub Pages is used to host the public website and documentation; user account data and private content are stored on our backend servers or third-party backends described below.</p>

    <p><strong>Analytics & tracking:</strong> We may use analytics services (e.g. Google Analytics or alternative analytics). These services collect usage information and may use cookies. You can opt out of analytics where applicable — see the <em>Your choices</em> section below.</p>

    <p><strong>Payments:</strong> If you subscribe to paid content, payments are handled by a third-party payment processor (for example, Stripe, PayPal, etc.). We only retain billing identifiers and transaction metadata necessary for billing and refunds. We do not store full payment card numbers on our servers.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Action required:</strong> Replace the placeholders below with your actual providers:
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting: <code>GitHub Pages</code> (public site)</li>
        <li>Analytics: <code>[INSERT_ANALYTICS_PROVIDER]</code> (optional)</li>
        <li>Payment processor: <code>[INSERT_PAYMENT_PROCESSOR]</code> (if you offer subscriptions)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to provide the service, remember preferences, support features (like sign in), and analyze usage. You can manage cookie settings via your browser; disabling certain cookies may affect app functionality.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the service, for account management, legal compliance, and to fulfill legitimate business needs (e.g., support, audit). If you request account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data as described in the <em>Your rights</em> section below, except to the extent we must retain certain records for legal purposes.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction or update of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal exceptions).</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict processing in certain circumstances.</li>
      <li>Request data portability where applicable.</li>
      <li>If you are in the EU/EEA or UK, you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Vinandi is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. If we become aware of a data breach that affects your personal data, we will comply with applicable breach notification laws.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Vinandi may transfer and store personal data on servers located outside your country of residence (including the United States or other jurisdictions). When we transfer personal data across borders, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (contractual protections, standard contractual clauses, or other legal mechanisms) as required by law.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we make changes, we will post the updated policy with the new effective date. Significant changes will be communicated through the app or by email when appropriate.</p>
